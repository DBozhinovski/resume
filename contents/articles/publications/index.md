### Building an application with CoffeeScript
#### PACKT publishing
2014

Building and application with CoffeeScript is a video course aimed at beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript developers. I built the course with the idea of it being as hands-on as possible in order to provide some working knowledge of the language to the audience.
