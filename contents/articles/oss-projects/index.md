### Prismatic

Prismatic is a promise-based wrapper for FFmpeg. It is used at the core of the video transcoding service I wrote for MediaLab. Realizing that promises aren't the catch-all solution I expected them to be, I created a spin-off library called prismatic-streams which uses streams instead of promises.

### AwesomePad

AwesomePad is a simple, offline, browser-based note-taking application which I built for a course I authored. I am currently writing a newer version of the app, by using a completely different approach to it.
