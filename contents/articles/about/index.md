I am a developer who likes to experiment, explore new technologies and combine existing ones towards new uses. I believe
the [UNIX way](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html) is the right way to develop software <sup>[*](/#unix)</sup>. I also like breaking stuff, for the educational value of it :)

I enjoy gaming, linux and hackery of any kind - be it a raspberry pi, browser, bash console and anything in-between. I love Linux, JavaScript and Node.js. Currently, I'm working with Backbone.js and Ractive trying to wrap my head around the finer points of [FRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) with the latter.
