I am a developer who likes to experiment, explore new technologies and combine existing ones towards new uses. I believe
the [UNIX way](http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html) is the right way to develop software <sup>[*](/#unix)</sup>. I also like breaking stuff, for science and for the educational value of it :)
